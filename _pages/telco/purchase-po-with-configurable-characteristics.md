A complex offering is a Product Offering (PO) with a significant number of Product Specification Characteristic (PSC) and Product Specification Characteristic Values (PSCVs), configurable or static, also with dependencies between them. These POs need to be purchased in B2B SPA from the Product Details Page (PDP) page or through Configurable Guided Selling.

Customers can purchase complex offerings, standalone or within a bundle, by viewing the details of the offerings and then select the required purchase options that are assigned to these offerings. Customers use this feature when they need to view product offering details or purchase offerings, either SPO or BPO.

## Business Need

Commercial offers, (product offerings) are offered to end customers in various contexts, are defined by respecting the definition of a specific type of product. For instance, a GSM product offering is defined by respecting the characteristics of a GSM product. A common set of characteristics of a GSM voice offer is represented by the number of minutes, SMS, and data volume that are included in the offer. These are the static characteristics that define an offer.

Some characteristics are not necessarily static. Considering the GSM offer example, the 'favourite number' might be provided by the customer as input when purchasing a new GSM postpaid offer. At the product definition level, the 'favourite number' is defined as a configurable characteristic of the product offering (PO). It is also possible to have multiple other characteristics where the customer needs to provide and/or select the value while purchasing. Some values might be mandatory where the customer can proceed with purchasing the offer by providing only the value for those mandatory characteristics.

In the B2B context, commercial offers that are offered to B2B customers are much more complex. In such case, the number of configurable characteristics is considerably higher than the context of B2C offers. Though it is not necessarily a rule, the number of configurable characteristics, sometimes, depends on the industry itself.

This feature enables customers to purchase those POs having configurable characteristics by visualizing the list of configurable characteristics and provide or select the value for those where the value type is either of the following: 

-   Text input
-   Numeric input
-   Date input
-   Selection of values: Simple selection or multiple selection   
-   Decision (true/ false)



## Business Use Case

**Static and Configurable Characteristics - Examples**

**Static PSCVU**

For products that are attached by characteristics to POs through those entitiesâ€™ PSCVUs, it allows the Product Manager to define the minimum and maximum number of values that need to be selected or provided for that characteristic plus other values.

If PSCVUs where the minimum and maximum cardinality and the number of values is equal, then it refers to the static characteristic. The characteristic remains the same irrespective of the purchase of the Product Offering, and therefore it is the static characteristic.

In the following image, **Connect_100** has four characteristics with one value wherein the minimum and maximum will be equal to one as there is only one PSCV.

**Configurable PSCVU**

If PSCVs assigned to a Product Offering has differences in minimum and maximum cardinality and number of values, then it refers to the configurable characteristic. In this case, the input and selection for those PSCVs needs to be provided by either the customer or from an external system.

An example of a configurable characteristic is where we have a list of values such as coverage areas, and the customer needs to select at least one but maximum two from four values.

For **Input Types**, there can be multiple selections, a list of values where the customer can select up to maximum cardinality, simple or single selection where the maximum cardinality is one and the customer is not able to select multiple values more than one, and there can also be Boolean text, number or date that the customer needs to select from. The Product Manager defines the PSCVs that are linked to a Product Offering.
