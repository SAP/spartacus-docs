## Business Need

## Business Use Case

**Viewing Subscribed Product Inventory, Billing Account, and Billing Agreements**

While browsing the SPA store, customers can either view their Subscribed Product Inventory list or details of a specific subscribed product.

The **Account** menu is updated with the **Selfcare** option, which includes modules such as “Subscriptions”, “Billing Accounts”, “Billing Agreements”. Going forward, the **Selfcare** option will be enhanced further to include more modules.

To view the Subscribed Product Inventory:

1. Log in to the TUA Spartacus.
  
1. Navigate to **Account** -> **Selfcare**.
