To support the commercial product catalog of product offerings, changes were required in the way "searches" are technically conducted to search for and find simple product offerings.  Changes were made in the areas of free text search, facets and top level category menu navigation.   The use of product specifications, which are used to create product offerings, are leveraged in search.

The following options are available while searching for a Product Offering:

- Menu:  Displays list of available options that the Customer can use to navigate through the product catalog
- Free Text Search:  Customer uses this option to manually search for product offerings based on their entry
- Facet searches:  Enhanced to easily filter search results list
