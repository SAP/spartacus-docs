## Overview

A Product Offering (PO) represents how the Product Specification is sold and contains the market details over a particular period of time. When customers select Products from the `ProductCatalog` (be it an online website or a brochure), it is the Product Offeringâ€™s details that they are looking at and which are reflected in what they agree to contractually.
