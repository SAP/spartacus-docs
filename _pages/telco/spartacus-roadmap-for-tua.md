### General Release Information

We plan to publish new Spartacus libraries every two weeks. Each release may contain bug fixes, improvements to user experience, and new features.

When new features are available for release, normally we will publish a pre-release “next” version of the libraries with the new features, in order to get feedback. When the final, new, minor version is ready, we usually publish a release candidate (RC), with the final new x.y.0 a few days or weeks later.

**Note:** Links provided in the following sections point to SAP Commerce Cloud Telco & Utilities Accelerator Help portal, to give an idea of what the feature is about. These links are for context-only.  While we strive for feature parity, the Spartacus implementation of features may not work exactly as in Accelerator.

### Planned for Rest of Q3 2020

The first Spartacus for TUA major release (1.0) is planned for early Q3 2020.

At a high level, this release includes the overall storefront, the ability to support simple product offerings and bundled product offerings, pricing (one-time charges, recurring charges, and usage charges), and configurable guided selling.
