This document describes what is planned for Spartacus for TUA for Q3 2020 and later.

*Last updated June 23, 2020 by Deborah Cholmeley-Jones, Solution Owner, TUA Spartacus*

### General Release Information

We plan to publish new Spartacus for TUA libraries every two weeks. Each release may contain bug fixes, improvements to user experience, and new features.

When new features are available for release, normally we will publish a pre-release "next" version of the libraries with the new features, in order to get feedback. When the final, new, and minor version is ready, we usually publish a release candidate (RC), with the final new x.y.0 a  weeks later. 

**Note:** Some of the links provided in the following lists point to SAP Commerce Cloud Telco & Utilities Storefront documentation, to give an idea of what the feature is about. These links are for context only. While we strive for feature parity, the Spartacus for TUA implementation of features may not work exactly as in SAP Commerce Cloud Telco & Utilities Storefront.
