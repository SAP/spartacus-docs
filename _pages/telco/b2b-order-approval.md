The feature allows managers to view and approve or reject orders. Whenever a customer purchases a product or places an order that requires an approval, it is sent to the manager who either approves or rejects the order.  

All orders waiting for approval will be in the pending approval state till the manager makes final decision on it. The manager views the details of the order and then decides to approve or reject the order. 

The feature includes the approval dashboard, which is displayed as a link under the main menu. This link is visible only to the company administrator and not to any other users, irrespective of their roles. The link is visible for the administrator even if the administrator plays multiple roles such as admin role and approver role. The approver can view the orders, pending for approval, within the approverâ€™s organization or unit or child unit.

## Business Need

Orders that require approval move to the pending approval state. To move to next state, it needs to be approved or rejected by the manager. This feature allows the company manager to view the order details and then approve or reject the order.

## Business Use Case

**Organization Structure**

Following diagram represents an organization structure that is grouped into different units and business units. The **Total Protect** is the main unit of the organization and is further structured into three different child units such as Coordination Center, Operation Center, and HR.

Each unit has separate users, who are employees of this organization, assigned to them. These users have different roles such as administrators or approvers or customers. In some cases, the user will have multiple roles such as an administrator and / or an approver. Such users are visible in the dashboard of the organization management that is accessible by the administrator who in turn can assign users to different units or can assign different roles to different users.

For this feature purpose, let us consider the approver role. At the parent unit level, Ross Carter is assigned as the b2b approver. In such a scenario, the approver, while accessing the approval dashboard, is able to see all orders within the company. This is because the approver is assigned to the main unit, which displays all orders within the company irrespective of the units each order belongs to. The approver can either approve or reject the listed orders for the company.

In case of Operation Center business unit, one of the child units, Mark Mann is assigned as the b2b approver. Mark would be able to view and either approve or reject the orders placed by users within this business unit.
