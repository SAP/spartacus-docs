The feature allows managers to view and approve or reject orders. Whenever a customer purchases a product or places an order that requires an approval, it is sent to the manager who either approves or rejects the order.  

All orders waiting for approval will be in the pending approval state till the manager makes final decision on it. The manager views the details of the order and then decides to approve or reject the order.
