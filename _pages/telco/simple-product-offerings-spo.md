## Overview

In TUA, there is a need to differentiate between a product and a product offering.  A Product Offering is a commercial representation of what can be sold to a customer in contrast to a product which is what a customer purchased.  A Product Offering is created based on product specifications, their characteristics and values; As well as defining all the applicable charges including one-time charges, recurring charges and usage-based charges.
