The telco and utilities accelerator for project "Spartacus" (TUA Spartacus) is a lean, Angular-based storefront for SAP Commerce Cloud working exclusively through the Commerce REST API. TUA Spartacus works with and enhances the Telco and Utilities Accelerator storefront. In addition to supporting Commerce REST APIs, the Telco and Utilities Accelerator supports TM Forum APIs for delivering industry-specific functionality.

Service providers can deliver personalized and relevant user experiences tailored to the needs of their customers. The TUA storefront provides a future-proof technical foundation for growth, quick time-to-market, and a competitive advantage for delivering innovative capabilities.
