As a result of Journey Management configuration, a product offerings may be defined with the requirement of an appointment to be scheduled. This means that an appointment reservation is required before the order can be successfully placed. The Journey Management appointment feature enables customers to make this reservation during the "Add to Cart" process.

Appointment selection and reservation in a productive system requires third-party integration to the appropriate backend system. This feature can be adapted to work with a customer-specific business process flow.

This feature applies to product offerings or product specifications that have a checklist policy for Appointment Reference and/or Installation Address configured. It is applicable to product offerings sold as a simple product offering or bundled product offering through configurable guided selling. For more information, see [Configurable Guided Selling](https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/latest/en-US/fa22e16db2524c0bb9b12c6102ba1b5d.html) in the TUA Help portal.

## Prerequisite

To test this feature using a mockup service, follow the instructions to set-up soapUI. Ensure that the Appointment system is always up and running.

**Note:** The mockup service is not recommended for the production environments as it is intended only for demonstration purpose.

1. Download [soapUI, version 5.6.0](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/latest-release/) as per your installed Operating System.
2. Navigate to the [TUA Spartacus git repository](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus-tua/releases/tag/1.1.0) and download the `mock_services.zip` file.
3. Extract the `mock_services.zip` file. The content of the ZIP when extracted is the `Resource_Pool_Management_API.xml` file.
4. Click the **Import** icon on the soapUI toolbar. The `Select soapUI Project` file dialog box opens. Import the  `Resource_Pool_Management_API.xml` file into the soapUI.
5. Right-click **Appointment** and then click **Start Minimized**. When the mock service is up, you can see that the Appointment mock service is also up and running.

## Business Use Cases

The following business use cases are covered for this feature:

1. A customer wants to purchase a product offering that requires an installation service at a preferred address specified by the customer.  During the "Add to â€œCart" process, the customer is prompted to specify the address and/or make an appointment reservation.   If the product offering has only an installation address policy configured, the appointment selection screen will not display.

2. A customer enters [Configurable Guided Selling](https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/latest/en-US/464d4b03d91442e9ac95f69808895a39.html) and wants to purchase a product offering that requires an installation service at a preferred address specified by the customer. During the "Add to Cart" process, the customer is prompted to specify the address and/or make an appointment reservation. If multiple products requires installation, the end customer will only be prompted once to provide this information making the configurable guided selling journey seamless.  Behind the scenes, the installation address and appointment will be copied to all product offerings requiring this information.   If the product offering has only an installation address policy configured, the appointment selection screen will not display.

3.  A customer has the ability to change the installation address and/or appointment from within the cart.

4.  A customer may not immediately place the order but instead waits until the next day, or the customer completely abandons the cart. After a defined period of time, the cart times-out and the appointment is automatically cancelled, and the slot can be made available for another customer.
