## Business Need

Organizational structure provides guidance to all employees by laying out the official reporting relationships that govern the workflow of the company.  A formal outline of a company's structure makes it easier to add new positions, roles, and authorizations in the company.

Structure provides clarity, helps to manage expectations, enables better purchase decision-making, and provides consistency.  It also helps with assignment of responsibility regarding budgets, cost, purchase limits, and workflow processes.

Administrators need to manage such organizational-related activities whenever required. This feature enables administrators to view and edit the company structure and the entities related to the company. 

## Business Use Case

**Organization Structure**

Following diagram represents an organization structure that is grouped into different units and business units. **Total Protect** is the name of the B2B company and is also the main unit of the organization. The company is further divided into three child business units including the Coordination Center, Operation Center, and Human Resources.

Each business unit has users or employees assigned. These users have different roles such as administrators, approvers, or customers. In some cases, the user will have multiple roles such as an administrator and an approver. The users are visible in the organization management dashboard that is accessible by the administrator. Administrators have the authorization to assign users to different business units or can assign different roles to different users.

Apart from business units and user roles, there are cost centers and budgets that can be assigned to any of the business units listed. The cost centers or budgets are defined by either of these units. Only company administrators can manage this information through the organizational dashboard.
