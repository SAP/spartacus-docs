## Overview

### General Release Information

Each release may contain bug fixes, improvements, and new features.

When new features are available for release, we will normally publish a pre-release “next” version of the libraries with new features, in order to get feedback. When the final, new, minor version is ready, we usually publish a release candidate (RC), with the final new x.y.0 a few days or weeks later.

Some of the links provided in the following lists point to SAP Commerce Cloud Financial Services Accelerator documentation, to give an idea of what the feature is about. These links are for context only. While we strive for feature parity, the FSA Spartacus implementation of features may not work exactly as in the Financial Services Accelerator.
