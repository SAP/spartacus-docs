## Overview

Business users can help their customers buy insurance and banking products by performing actions in the portal on their behalf. 

## Back-End Requirements

The On-Behalf-Of Framework is based on the On-Behalf-Of consent (OBOConsent) and a new user group named Seller Group (sellergroup).
For more details on the back-end implementation and requirements, see our documentation on the [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a7d0f0c5faa44002bf81e1a9a91c77e2/latest/en-US/cbf7b289a4414090a26e23077e2e4e1f.html).   

## Front-End Requirements

To support this feature on the storefront, we have introduced the Agent Dashboard.
