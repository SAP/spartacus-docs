title: FSA Order Splitting
---

## Overview

Order splitting offers a possibility for insurance carriers to sell third-party products together with insurance products.
After an order is submitted, the splitting starts in the backend within the order process. More info about this feature can be found [here](https://help.sap.com/viewer/DRAFT/6ac05cfc1e2a41dca9cfa29de18cd01a/2102/en-US/56981ba123fb4801b56263ba24177575.html).


On the Order History page, the customer can see all the details related to that specific order, and the third-party products will have the 'Track package' link available.
