title: FSA Order Splitting
---

**Note**: This feature is introduced with version 2.0 of the FSA Spartacus libraries.

Order splitting offers a possibility for insurance carriers to sell third-party products together with insurance products.
After an order is submitted, the splitting starts in the back end within the order process. For more information, see [Quotation and Application Process](https://help.sap.com/viewer/6ac05cfc1e2a41dca9cfa29de18cd01a/2102/en-US/56981ba123fb4801b56263ba24177575.html) on the SAP Help Portal.

On the Order History page, the customer can see all the details related to that specific order, and the third-party products will have the 'Track package' link available.
