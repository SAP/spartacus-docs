**Note**: This feature is introduced with version 3.0 of the FSA Spartacus libraries.

The integration with Live Contract enabled another enhancement of the insurance agent capabilities - besides agent data, customers can also see if a certain agent is currently available.

## Prerequisites

To enable this feature, you need to integrate your project with Live Contract. For more information, see [Speak to an Agent]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/agents/claims/fsa-speak-to-agent.md %}).

## Integration

To enable this particular functionality of the integration with Live Contract, add the following ImPex file through the Administration Console:

```ts

INSERT_UPDATE Endpoint; id[unique = true]; version[unique = true]; name; specUrl
; syncPilot-agent-request ; unknown ; syncPilot-agent-request ; "https://sync-pilot-integration-server-url"
INSERT_UPDATE DestinationTarget; id[unique = true]
; syncpilot-agent-destination
INSERT_UPDATE ConsumedDestination[impex.legacy.mode = true]; id[unique = true]; url; endpoint(id, version); destinationTarget(id);
; FS-SyncPilot-Agent-Request ; "https://sync-pilot-integration-server-url" ; syncPilot-agent-request:unknown ; syncpilot-agent-destination ;

```
Note that the integration server link is specific for each integration and in the ImpEx, you need to enter the one created specifically for your project.

##User Interface

Once enabled, customers are able to see the agent availability on the Map View of the **Find an Agent** page. Below the agent profile image, the availability will be displayed as online or offline. Based on this, customers will know which agent they can contact.
