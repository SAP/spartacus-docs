title: FSA Agent Availability
---

The integration with Live Contract enables another enhancement of the insurance agent capabilities - besides agent data, customers can also see if a certain agent is currently available.

## Prerequisites

To enable this feature, you need to integrate your project with Live Contract. For more information, see [Speak to an Agent]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/features/agents/fsa-speak-to-agent.md %}).

## Integration

To enable this particular functionality of the integration with Live Contract, add the following ImpEx file through the Administration Console:

```ts

INSERT_UPDATE Endpoint; id[unique = true]; version[unique = true]; name; specUrl
; syncPilot-agent-request ; unknown ; syncPilot-agent-request ; "https://sync-pilot-integration-server-url"
INSERT_UPDATE DestinationTarget; id[unique = true]
; syncpilot-agent-destination
INSERT_UPDATE ConsumedDestination[impex.legacy.mode = true]; id[unique = true]; url; endpoint(id, version); destinationTarget(id);
; FS-SyncPilot-Agent-Request ; "https://sync-pilot-integration-server-url" ; syncPilot-agent-request:unknown ; syncpilot-agent-destination ;

```
Note that the integration server link is specific for each integration. In the ImpEx, enter the one created for your project.

## User Interface

With this functionality enabled, logged-in customers can see the agent availability on both the Map and the List View of the **Find an Agent** page. 
Based on this, customers will know which agent they can contact.

When the agent is online, on the Map view, their profile image is circled with a blue line with a green dot. 
Also, the phone icon indicates that the agent is available for a call.

On the List view, the phone icon inside the agent card shows that the agent is online.
