## General information step

On the third step of the Incident Report - General Information, several new questions have been added, in the form of the radio buttons. These answers are also sent to the CPI and further to the FS-CM to be processed. The last answer has been extended with the additional query in a form of a dropdown if the user selects 'Yes'.
