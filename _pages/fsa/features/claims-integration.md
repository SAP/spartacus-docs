## Upload section

On the second step of the Incident Report, an Upload control has been added. It serves the purpose of handling files uploaded by users in the Claim process.

## General information step

On the third step of the Incident Report - General Information, several new questions have been added, in the form of the radio buttons. The answers that the customer provides in this form are also sent to the SAP Cloud Integration, and further to the FS-CM to be processed. In the last question, if the user selects ‘Yes’, an additional query has been added in a form of a dropdown.
