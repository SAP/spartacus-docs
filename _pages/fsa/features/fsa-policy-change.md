## Overview

The Policy Change Process framework enables insurance carriers to provide their customers with the possibility to change their policy online.
In addition to sample processes for changing mileage and adding coverages, customers can now add additional drivers and remove coverages. All sample processes are provided based on the Auto Insurance product. The policy change can be cancelled at any time during change process in case the simulated premium does not match customer's expectation, in which case the customer will be redirected to the 'Policy Details' page again.

User is presented with the form requesting information about the additional driver. Note that 'Effective date' field is disabled and cannot be changed by the policyholder.
