title: Form Submission
---

This page will explain how to persist form-data content in a database when submission of the form is triggered from the "outside". It basically means that we want to submit a form that is in one component, but the submit button (trigger for form saving) is in a completely different and independent component. 
This was implemented in order to allow customers to execute different logic upon submit has been finished. That logic can be as simple as redirection to some page, or something more complex such as calculation etc.
