## Accessing the Quote Details Page

Customers can preview their quotes in the **Quotes & Applications** section of the My Account area. 
Each quote is displayed as a card, similar to other sections of My Account (e.g. Claims, Policies).

A quote card contains general information about the quote, such as chosen product plan, quote status, expiry date, as well as the price and payment frequency details. 
From the quote card, the customer can retrieve the quote or choose to see more details. 
When the customer clicks the **DETAILS** button, a separate Quote Details page opens.

## Quote Details Page Contents

The structure of this page is similar to the Policy Details page. 
On the Quotes Details page, the customer can see the following sections:
- **Summary** - general information about the chosen product, quote status, price, and payment frequency  
- **What's Included** - list of products included in the selected product plan
- **Optional Extras** - list of optional products (included and not included)
- **What Does it Cost Me** - price and payment frequency  

All the details on the Quote Details page are for preview only. 
If customers wish to change something in the quote, they need to retrieve it. 
They can do that by clicking the **RETRIEVE** button at the bottom of the page.
