## Overview

In the First Notice Of Loss process, it is required to provide evidence of the accident by uploading adequate files. 
Claims that are in status PROCESSING may require additional proof before being approved by the claim handler or the customer may have missed adding the document when submitting the claim. 
The customer can go back to the claim and add the needed proof. 
Note that claims that are in status OPEN (the claim has not been submitted yet) or REJECTED (the claim has been rejected by the claim handler) cannot be updated. 


## Updating Claims

After logging in, the customer locates the claim that needs an update on the Claims page in the My Account area. 
The customer adds documents by clicking the **ADD DOCUMENTS** button on the claim card.
