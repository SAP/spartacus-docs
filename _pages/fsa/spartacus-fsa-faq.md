**What is Financial Services Accelerator?**

Financial Services Accelerator (FSA) is a tailor-made omni-channel solution for insurance companies and other financial services providers such as retail banks. FSA provides a streamlined, seamless and personalized customer experience while meeting the unique needs of the insurance and financial services industry.

Financial Services Accelerator includes preconfigured reference integration and website templates for the insurance and banking industry. Customers are guided through each step of the quote process, during which they can choose from various products and riders, and are able to enter all the relevant data through customized forms that adapt based on their answers.

Customers are provided with a summary of their choices and the options to create a quote, save it for later review or issue a policy on the spot. The FSA also provides a rich self-service area for customers to inquire about policies, premiums and claims.
