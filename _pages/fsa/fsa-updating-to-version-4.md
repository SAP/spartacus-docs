## Upgrading FSA Spartacus Libraries from Version 3.0.0 to 3.0.1


## Overview

Patch version 3.0.1 of FSA Spartacus Libraries contains a fix related to missing dependencies detected in version 3.0.0.


### Prerequisites

Before upgrading your FSA Spartacus libraries to version 3.0.1, you must address the following prerequisites:

- Make sure all of your `@spartacus` libraries are upgraded to **Spartacus 3.4.0**. 
- Note that this version of Spartacus requires **Angular version 10.2.4**. 
If your Angular version is <10.2.4, you must update it before updating Spartacus. 
For more information, see the official [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).
  

### Updating FSA Spartacus

1. Depending on whether you use yarn or npm for installations, delete `yarn.lock` file or `package-lock.json` file from your project.

2. Go to the `package.json` file at the root of your project and make sure you have the following versions of Spartacus libraries:

    ```shell
    "@spartacus/assets": "^3.4.0",
    "@spartacus/core": "^3.4.0",
    "@spartacus/organization": "3.4.0",
    "@spartacus/storefinder": "^3.4.0",
    "@spartacus/storefront": "3.4.0",
    "@spartacus/user": "3.4.0",
    "@spartacus/styles": "^3.4.0",
    ```
   
3. Upgrade FSA Spartacus libraries:  
   
     ```shell
     "@spartacus/dynamicforms": "^3.0.1",
     "@spartacus/fsa-storefront": "^3.0.1",
     "@spartacus/fsa-styles": "^3.0.1",
     ```

5. To complete the update, run the following commands:

    ```shell
    yarn install
    yarn start
    ```

***
   
**NOTE**: If you get errors related to font-icons, perform the following steps:

1. Run the following command:

    `ng add @spartacus/fsa-schematics --baseSite=sample-financial-site --currency=usd,eur --language=en,de,fr`

2. When prompted, enter your base site URL (that is, your back-end server URL).

3. After that, you should be able to run `ng serve` or `yarn start` without any errors.

    ```
   
   **NOTE:** Make sure that all Angular packages that you already have under `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file match the version of the `@angular/corelibrary`, which is **~12.0.5**.  
   
3. Next, install dependencies with the following command:

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```
   
4. After the installation is completed, your app structure needs to be updated to meet new Spartacus requirements. 
   To do that, you need to replace the existing `app` folder with the one that contains the required structure.
   You can download a ready-made `app` folder with the new structure on the link provided below.
   Perform the following steps:
    - [Download new app.zip](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus-financial-services-accelerator/releases/download/fsa-storefront-4.0.0/app.zip).
    - Navigate to `mystore/src/`.
    - Delete the existing `app` folder.
    - Unpack the downloaded `app.zip` folder to that same location (`mystore/src/`).
   
 5. Now that you have the new app structure, you need to set the `baseUrl`:
     - Navigate to `app/spartacus`.
     - Find and open `fs-configuration.module.ts`, which holds the configuration necessary for the FSA to function correctly.
     - Edit `baseUrl` property so that it points to your back-end server.

6. To complete the update, run the following command:

    ```shell
    yarn start
    ```
