## Release 3.0
*Release 3.0 libraries published October 7, 2021*

List of features delivered with 3.0:
- **[Enablement of Coupons and Discounts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/features/fsa-coupons.md %})**
 : Customers can apply coupons during the quotation process and obtain a discount on the policy premium. When a customer adds the coupon code, the amount they saved is shown on the storefront. The customer can also remove the coupon during the quotation process. This process is also supported in the E2E Auto quotation process in integration with S4I and PQM. Customers can see their coupons in the dedicated section of the My Account area. 
- **[Product Discovery]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/features/fsa-product-discovery.md %})**
 : Product Discovery Enhancement enables customers to find the best suitable product for their needs using a questionnaire. Customers respond to the questions related to their insurance targets and, based on their answers, products are filtered. The ones that suit best are recommended, and customers can start the quotation process. The questionnaire is configurable and can be easily changed. Life and Savings products are used as examples for implementation, but other products can also be added.
- **[Claims Details Page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/features/claims/claims-details-page.md %})**
 : This feature enables customers to see more details about their claims. Besides general information, customers can now see details about payments, persons involved, and associated documents.
- **Document Accessibility**
  : Customers can see all their received and uploaded documents at one glance on the My Documents page in the My Account area. Documents can be shown in two different accordions. Customers can download documents directly from this page.
- **Address Management**
 : Customers can manage their address at a central place in the My Account area. This address is then consistently used in quotation and application processes. If the customer adds an address during the quotation process, the address will be saved, and can later be changed in the My Account area.
- **Live Contract Integration**
 : The integration of the Financial Services Accelerator with LiveContract offers financial companies the possibility to create a new kind of sales channel, combining the advantages of an agent-driven approach with the flexibility and cost advantages of online communication. This integration enables agents to keep in contact with their customers in a personal and individual way. Both customers and agents can enter in person-to-person interaction, which gives them flexibility in discussions, and the ability to explain and discuss complex matters, unlike how it is done in artificial dialogs via chatbot. In addition to this, customers can now easily find the information about agent availability on the Find an Agent page. Besides agent data, customers can see if an agent is online or offline. For more information, see [Speak to an Agent]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/features/agents/fsa-speak-to-agent.md %}) and [Agent Availability]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/features/agents/fsa-agent-availability.md %}).
- **[Quote Details Page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/fsa/features/fsa-quote-details-page.md %})**
 : The Quote Details page allows financial customers to view all the details related to their quote on a separate page in the Quotes & Applications section of the My Account area. 

## Release 2.0
*Release 2.0 libraries published March 17, 2021*
  
List of features delivered with 2.0:
- **Additional Policy Changes**
 : The Policy Change Process framework enables insurance carriers to provide their customers with the possibility to change their policy online. In addition to sample processes for changing mileage and adding coverage, customers can now add the additional driver and remove coverage. All sample processes are provided based on the Auto Insurance product.  The policy change can be initiated for effective policies, and the customer can choose one of the available policy changes. Once the process is started, customers can specify the desired change and then be presented with a simulated premium. The policy change can then be submitted or canceled if the simulated premium does not match the customer's expectation. The Policy Change Process is based on the User Request Framework, allowing business users to make changes in the process directly from Backoffice.  
- **Claims Integration Enhancements**  
  : The Financial Services Accelerator is seamlessly integrated with SAP Claims Management. When a first notice of loss is submitted via the Financial Services Accelerator, it reaches SAP Claims Management, and if all data is valid, a claim is created. Besides form data, the customer can upload documents, and the document data will be forwarded to the SAP Claims Management. General information about the claim, e.g., claim number, status, and claim handler information, is then sent back to Financial Services Accelerator as a response to the first notice of loss call.  
- **Document Upload**
 : Document upload offers the possibility to upload additional information in a certain process, which also helps banks and insurers to collect all needed information and documents during a process (e.g., application or quotations processes, claims process). The customer can upload one or more documents in the same process. During the document upload, customers can download or remove already uploaded documents. Two document storage strategies are provided:
    : - SAP Commerce Cloud, financial services accelerator
    : - External DMS by using provided integration mechanisms (prepackaged integration with SAP Document Management service available).
- **Invoice Payment**
  : During the quotation process, the customer can choose to pay either with a credit card or through an invoice in the Payment Details step. If an invoice method is selected, the customer proceeds to the Final Review step without adding any additional information. In the case of a credit card payment method, the customer first needs to register a new credit card.  
- **Order Splitting**
  : Order splitting allows orders to be broken down into several consignments interfaces, which permits separate billing and shipment of third-party products. The Order Splitting process in the Financial Services Accelerator is visible on the Auto Product sample when a customer decides to include winter tires into their auto policy. Once the order is submitted, for each set of order entries, a consignment is created. In this case, the order is split into two consignments - one for the policy itself, and the second for the third-party product. The policy is then processed via a policy management system. As the policy is issued, the customer can see its details in My Account > Policies. The third-party product is charged as a one-time payment and shipped to the customer. Customers are informed via email about the shipment and can track their order in the newly added Order History page in the 'My Account' area. This is also where customers can see all the details of the order they have created.
