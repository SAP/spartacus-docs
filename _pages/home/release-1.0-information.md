### Release 1.0.0 - available July 4, 2019

- When we say "released", we mean that we produce tested Spartacus libraries from develop branch
- We usually release new libraries every 2 weeks (hosted on npmjs.com)
- To be able to use all functionality in Spartacus 1.0, Release 1905 of SAP Commerce Cloud is required; most of Spartacus can work with 1811 and previous releases, with no guarantees the farther back you go. Specifically, the following features require 1905:
  - SmartEdit support
  - Any usage of  new CmsFlexComponents or SiteContextComponent (although you can use other components such as JspComponent)
  - Forgot password / reset
  - Various bug fixes to OCC APIs that help Spartacus work better

### How Spartacus is Versioned

Spartacus is following semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch).

- A new patch release (1.2.**3** > 1.2.**4** for example) means we added fixes or improvements but no new features.
- A new minor release (1.**2**.4 > 1.**3**.0 for example)  means we added a new feature and possibly fixes and improvements.

For both patch and minor releases, upgrading to the new libraries should not cause any compatibility problems with your storefront app. If anything, a new feature might have to be turned off because you don't wish to use it. We hope you will upgrade frequently.

- A new major release (**1**.3.2 > **2**.0.0 for example) means that, besides adding new features and improvements, we made changes that will likely cause compatibility issues. Your app likely needs updating when moving to a new major release. These effects, reasons, and benefits will be documented.

We don't plan to introduce a new major release that frequently, unless an issue is found that makes it necessary to move to a major release . The upcoming Angular "Ivy" (after Angular 8) is one factor in our eventual decision to do so.
