# General Roadmap Plans

We plan to release updates to the Spartacus libraries every 2 weeks.

Every release will contain bug fixes and improvements to user experience and performance. 

The order shown generally reflects the order of prioritization. For example, guest checkout is high on the list because we will work on that soon after 1.0 release.
