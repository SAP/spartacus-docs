## Release 3.1.0-next.0 - Thursday, January 28, 2021

### SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing

We're happy to announce that the Spartacus library for SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing has been released. This library provides the following features:

- single-level and multilevel configurable products in your Spartacus storefront, where the product model resides in SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA
- a configuration page with the most commonly used characteristic types, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down listboxes, and images for characteristic values
- a price summary at the bottom of the configuration page with the base price, the price of the selected options, and the total price of the configured product
- an overview page with all user selections accessible at any time during configuration
- basic conflict handling
- inclusion of configurable products as part of storefront processes, such as catalog browsing, product detail page, add to cart, checkout, and order history

The SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing add-on for Commerce provides the user interface (UI) with which configurable products can be configured and sold using SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing.

**Note:** The SAP Variant Configuration and Pricing add-on for Commerce is not included with the Spartacus libraries.

**Note:** Starting with Spartacus 3.1, you must install the Qualtrics feature library to be able to use Qualtrics features. You can install the Qualtrics library by running the following command:

## Pre-Release Libraries for 3.0.0 and earlier

Pre-release libraries are no longer published for versions 3.0.0 and earlier, as the final releases of these libraries were published. Pre-release libraries are still available but the final versions should be used. New pre-release libraries will be published as needed for 3.1, 3.2, and so on.

## Customer Data Cloud Pre-Release

The **Customer Data Cloud** (CDC, previously known as Gigya) integration library remains in pre-release and will likely be final Q1 2021. This new library provides authentication and consent management through CDC instead of whatâ€™s out-of-the-box SAP Commerce Cloud.
