_Last updated August 17, 2020 by Bill Marcotte, Senior Product Manager, Spartacus_

For an overview of what is included in a specific release, see [Release Information]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/home/release-information.md %}). For detailed release notes, see the Spartacus repository [Releases page](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/releases).


## 2.1 Pre-Release Libraries

Release 2.1 has been published! See [Release Information]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/home/release-information.md %}) for more information on release 2.1.

## Customer Data Cloud Pre-Release

The **Customer Data Cloud** (CDC, previously known as Gigya) integration library remains in pre-release and will likely be final alongside the 3.0 release. This new library provides authentication and consent management through CDC instead of whatâ€™s out-of-the-box SAP Commerce Cloud. For more information, see the [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/install/integrations/cdc-integration.md %}).


## Pre-Release Libraries for 2.0 and earlier

Pre-release libraries are no longer actively updated for versions 2.0 and earlier, as the final release of these libraries was already published. Pre-release libraries are still available but the final versions should be used.
