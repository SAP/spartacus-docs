## 2.1 Pre-Release Libraries - August 12

- **Style Library Versioning**: Allows the core Spartacus development team to introduce  gradual changes in the style layer while maintaining backwards compatibility. New or adjusted style rules are added for a specific version, but these changes are not added in the style build process unless you explicitly opt in to receive these changes. For more information, see the [draft documentation](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus-docs/blob/develop/_pages/dev/styling-and-page-layout/css-architecture.md).
- **Directionality**: Provides support for bidirectional text and layout. You can configure Spartacus to use a left-to-right (LTR) orientation, or a right-to-left (RTL) orientation. The 2.1 feature is for core functionality; that Spartacus updates to CSS will be completed in the 3.0. For more information, see the [draft documentation](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus-docs/blob/5c42b580f2cdcfc5ced44a559658ac30be3a9be5/_pages/dev/styling-and-page-layout/directionality.md).
- The first pre-release of the **Customer Data Cloud** (CDC, previously known as Gigya) integration library was also published. This new library provides authentication and consent management through CDC instead of whatâ€™s out-of-the-box SAP Commerce Cloud. For more information, see the [draft documentation](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus-docs/blob/develop/_pages/install/integrations/cdc-integration.md).


## Pre-Release Libraries for 2.0 and earlier

Pre-release libraries are no longer actively updated for versions 2.0 and earlier, as the final release of these libraries was already published. Pre-release libraries are still available but the final versions should be used.
