## Pre-Release Libraries for 3.1 and Earlier

Pre-release libraries are no longer published for libraries that are officially released. Pre-release libraries are still available but the final versions should be used. New pre-release libraries will be published as needed for future releases.

## Customer Data Cloud Pre-Release

The **Customer Data Cloud** (CDC, previously known as Gigya) integration library remains in pre-release and will likely be final Q1 2021. This new library provides authentication and consent management through CDC instead of whatâ€™s out-of-the-box SAP Commerce Cloud.
