## Changes in Checkout Components

- `cx-order-details-headline` selector has been deleted because its corresponding component was deleted.
- `cx-order-confirmation-overview` placeholder selector was renamed to `cx-order-overview`.
- `z-index` set to 0 on `%cx-searchbox` to prevent it from overlapping with the hamburger menu on tablets.
