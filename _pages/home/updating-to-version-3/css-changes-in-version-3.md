## Changes in Checkout Components

* `cx-order-details-headline` selector has been deleted since its corresponding component was deleted.
* `cx-order-confirmation-overview` placeholder selector was renamed to `cx-order-overview`
* `z-index` set to 0 on `%cx-searchbox` to prevent it from overlapping the hamburger menu on tablet
