## Overview

### General Release Information

New Spartacus libraries are usually published every week. Each release may contain bug fixes, improvements, and new features.

When new features are available for release, normally we will publish a pre-release "next" version of the libraries with the new features, in order to get feedback. When the final, new, minor version is ready, we usually publish a release candidate (RC), with the final new x.y.0 a few days or weeks later.

Some of the links provided in the following lists point to SAP Commerce Cloud Accelerator or platform documentation, to give an idea of what the feature is about. These links are for context only. While we strive for feature parity, the Spartacus implementation of features may not work exactly as in Accelerator.
