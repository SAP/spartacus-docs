title: Feature Compatibility
---

The following table lists the Spartacus libraries release version for each feature, as well as the relevant version of SAP Commerce Cloud that is required.

Spartacus is compatible with SAP Commerce Cloud version 1905 or higher, although SAP Commerce Cloud version 2005 or newer is recommended. In the table below, you can see which Spartacus features require API endpoints that are only available in newer versions of SAP Commerce Cloud.

**Note:** For the required version of SAP Commerce Cloud, some features do not rely on specific endpoints in the back end, so the version indicated in the table is `n/a` (that is, not applicable).

**Note:** For versions that are indicated with an asterisk (*), see the relevant feature documentation for further details.
