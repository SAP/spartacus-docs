title: Feature Release Versions
---

The following table lists the Spartacus libraries release version for each feature, as well as the relevant version of SAP Commerce Cloud that is required.

For the required version of SAP Commerce Cloud, some features do not rely on specific endpoints in the back end, so the version indicated in the table is `n/a` (that is, not applicable).

**Note:** Spartacus should only be used with SAP Commerce Cloud 1905 or newer.
