### Overview

- When we say "released", we mean that we make new, official, tested Spartacus libraries available to the public (hosted on npmjs.com)
- We usually release new libraries every 2 weeks 
- A change in minor means we added new features, but they are configured to be off by default, so as not to cause compatibility issues. A new minor also means inclusion of changes or bug fixes that may affect compatibility, but these are also controlled by feature flags. So all significant changes are “opt-in”. See feature flag documentation for more information.
- We will normally publish pre-release libraries labelled 'next' a few weeks before a new minor release. The goal is to provide early access to new features and get feedback from the community.
- It’s important to note that if you choose not to use the new features, you should have no problems upgrading to a new 1.# with features flag set to a previous 1.#. If you do see a problem, please report a bug and we’ll assess and fix it. We encourage you to upgrade to latest libraries frequently during development.
- To use the new libraries, set your @spartacus libraries in package.json to “~1.#.0" (replace # with the release number). Then run `yarn upgrade` (although deleting your node_modules and doing yarn install is usually cleaner).
- To be able to use all functionality in Spartacus 1.\*, release 1905 of SAP Commerce Cloud is required. The latest patch release is strongly recommended as it usually contains bug fixes that affect Spartacus. Most of Spartacus can work with 1811, with no guarantees the farther back you go. Specifically, the following features require 1905:
  - SmartEdit support
  - Any usage of  new CmsFlexComponents or SiteContextComponent (although you can use other components such as JspComponent)
  - Forgot password / reset
  - Various bug fixes to OCC APIs that help Spartacus work better

### How Spartacus is Versioned

Spartacus is following semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch).

- A new patch release (1.2.**3** > 1.2.**4** for example) means we added fixes or improvements but no new features.
- A new minor release (1.**2**.4 > 1.**3**.0 for example)  means we added a new feature and possibly fixes and improvements.

For both patch and minor releases, upgrading to the new libraries should not cause any compatibility problems with your storefront app. (If it does, report a bug.) All new features and fixes are implemented in a compatible way. For example, all new features are disabled by default using feature flags. We hope you will upgrade frequently.

- A new major release (**1**.3.2 > **2**.0.0 for example) means that, besides adding new features and improvements, we made changes that will likely cause compatibility issues. Your app likely needs updating when moving to a new major release. These effects, reasons, and benefits will be documented.

We don't plan to introduce a new major release that frequently, unless an issue is found that makes it necessary to move to a major release . The upcoming Angular "Ivy" (after Angular 8) is one factor in our eventual decision to do so.
