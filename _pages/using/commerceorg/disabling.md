title: Disabling and Deleting Commerce Organization Entities
---

# Overview

Due to the interconnected nature of Commerce Organization entities, units, users, cost centers, and most other items can be disabled only, and cannot be deleted.

Disabling something like a user means that the user cannot make purchases and cannot be edited. The user must be re-enabled first.

An easier way to explain this is:
- Shipping addresses and user groups can be deleted
- Everything else can only be disabled

# Warning when disabling units

Many Commerce Organzation entities are connected through units. For this reason, if you disable a unit, all children of the unit and related entities are disabled, included users, cost centers, and budgets. 

A warning message is displayed when disabling items.
