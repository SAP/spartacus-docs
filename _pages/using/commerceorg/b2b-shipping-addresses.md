title: Shipping Addresses
---

When a buyer chooses to pay by account, a cost center must be selected in order to check out. When a cost center is chosen, the unit that the cost center is assigned to determines which shipping addresses are available.

Shipping addresses are owned by units. There is no separate list of addresses, and addresses cannot be assigned to other units. At least one shipping address must be created, or else the buyer cannot complete checkout. The following is an example:

## Creating a Shipping Address

1. From the **My Company** home page, click **Units**.

2. Select the unit to which you want to add a new shipping address.

3. Click **Shipping Addresses**.

4. Click **Create**, and then fill in the following required fields:

   - **Country** (affects display of states)
   - **Title** and **Name** of shipping receiver
   - **Address**
   - **City**
   - **State**
   - **Postal code**
   - **Phone number**

   The following is an example:

For the purposes of this tutorial, create at least two addresses.

## Deleting Addresses

Unlike other Commerce Organization entities, shipping addresses can be deleted. Deleting an address does not affect orders that have already been placed because the information is copied and made a part of the order.
