# Overview

A budget is used to limit spending for overall groups of people. Purchases count against budgets by being associated with cost centers. Buyers must select a cost center when checking out, so the purchase total is counted against that budget.

Budgets are not optional; an error will occur if a cost center is used without a corresponding budget. The same budget can be assigned to multiple cost centers.

# Creating a budget

1. From the My Company home page, click Budgets.

2. Click Add, and then fill in the required fields.

   - Name and Code
   - Start and end dates
   - Currency
   - Amount
   - Unit

Initially the budget is not assigned to any cost center.
