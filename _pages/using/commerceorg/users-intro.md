title: Users - Introduction
---

When creating users, every user must have a role. With SAP Commerce, out of the box, there are 4 types of user roles available:

- Customer (Buyer): Places orders.
- Approver: Reviews and approvers or rejects orders placed by buyers, when the order goes beyond the purchase limit set for the buyer. Cannot make purchases.
- Administrator: Makes changes to the units and user settings in the organization. Cannot make purchases.
- Manager: Not used in the out-of-the-box sample data.

You can create a user for a unit within the unit view or separately by displaying all users.

The following examples create users from within the units view.
