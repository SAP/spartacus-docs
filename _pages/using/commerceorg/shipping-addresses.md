title: Shipping Addresses

# Overview

When a buyer chooses to pay by Account, a cost center must be selected in order to check out. When a cost center is chosen, the available shipping addresses are the ones owned by the unit that the cost center is assigned to.

Shipping addresses are owned by units; there's no separate list of addresses, and addresses cannot be assigned to other units. At least one shipping address must be created or else the buyer cannot complete checkout.
