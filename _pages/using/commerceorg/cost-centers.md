# Overview

A cost center is a simple entity meant for tracking purchases. A cost center can only be assigned to a single unit. Cost centers can be linked to multiple budgets, which are used for limiting spending in various ways.

A buyer selects a cost center during the B2B Store purchase flow, playing an important role for B2B Commerce Organization. For example:
- The shipping addresses available to the buyer depending on the cost center selected.
- The budget(s) the order applies against are selected through the choice of cost center.
