title: Disabling and Deleting Commerce Organization Entities
---

You can disable Commerce Organization entities, such as units, users, cost centers, and most other entities, but you cannot delete them. This is due to the interconnected nature of Commerce Organization entities.

Disabling an entity, such as a user, means that the user cannot make purchases and cannot be edited. The user must be re-enabled first.

Another way of thinking about disabling and deleting entities is this:

- Shipping addresses and user groups can be deleted
- Everything else can only be disabled

## Warning When Disabling Units

Many Commerce Organization entities are connected through units. For this reason, if you disable a unit, all children of the unit and related entities are disabled, including users, cost centers, and budgets.

A warning message is displayed when disabling entities.
