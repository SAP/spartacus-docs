A budget is used to limit spending for overall groups of people. Purchases count against budgets by being associated with cost centers. Buyers must select a cost center when checking out, so the purchase total is counted against that budget.

Budgets are not optional. An error will occur if a cost center is used without a corresponding budget. The same budget can be assigned to multiple cost centers.

## Creating a Budget

1. From the **My Company** home page, click **Budgets**.

2. Click **Add**, and then fill in the following required fields:

   - **Name**
   - **Code**
   - **Start date**
   - **End date**
   - **Currency**
   - **Amount**
   - **Unit**

Initially, the budget is not assigned to any cost center.

## Assigning a Budget to a Cost Center

1. From the **My Company** home page, click **Cost Centers**.

2. Select the cost center that will have a budget assigned to it.

3. Click **Manage**, then click **Assign** for the budget you want to assign.

4. Click **Done**.

   The budget **Bud1** was assigned to **Cost Center 2**, as shown in the following example:
