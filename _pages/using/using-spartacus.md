title: Using the Spartacus Storefront
---

The Spartacus storefront is designed to be as intuitive as possible. However, the following documentation is provided to guide you through those parts of the storefront UI that may require a little more explanation:

- [{% assign linkedpage = site.pages | where: "name", "b2b-commerce-organization-tutorial.md" %}{{ linkedpage[0].title }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/using/commerceorg/landing-page/b2b-commerce-organization-tutorial.md %})
