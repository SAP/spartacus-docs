Following WCAG 2.1 definition of conformance, if there is no content to which a success criterion applies, the success criterion is satified. In plain words, the following critera do not apply to Spartacus, therefore are satisfied.

- 1.2.4, Level AA, Captions (Live)
- 2.1.4, Level A, Character Key Shortcuts
- 2.5.4, Level A, Motion Actuation

When new features get added to Spartacus and become subject of conformance, this page will be updated.
