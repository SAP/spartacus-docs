The image zoom feature allows you to display larger versions of the images on the product details page. When you click on the main image, an image zoom dialog appears and the mouse pointer turns into a magnifying glass. When you click the mouse again, an enlarged version of the image appears, and you can hover your mouse over the image and move it around to "zoom in" and focus on different areas of the image.
