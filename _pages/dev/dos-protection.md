title: Denial of Service Attacks Protection
---

Spartacus libraries do not offer any Denial of Service attacks protection. It is out of scope.

Third party libraries used by Spartacus are scanned regularly. 
If vulnerabilities are found, library versions are updated, or their usage goes through an internal security review process. 

[Denial of Service attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Denial_of_Service) prevention steps should be taken at the infrastructure level as part of deployment planning of Commerce Suite in a production environment. 

Please follow the guidelines of SAP Commerce [Security](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9433604f14ac4ed98908c6d4e7d8c1cc/2105/en-US/420e99cf09244637a220cf5e56b265b1.html)
