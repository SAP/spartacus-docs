title: Spartacus API
---

The Spartacus API documentation is hosted here: [https://sap.github.io/spartacus/](https://sap.github.io/spartacus/)

If you wish to see the API documentation for a specific version of Spartacus, you can check out the relevant release branch in your cloned Spartacus GitHub repository (for example, `release/5.0.x`), and then run `yarn generate:docs`.

**Note:** The 5.x release of the Spartacus libraries works only with SAP Commerce Cloud version 2105 or newer.

**Note:** The Spartacus API is separate from the Commerce Cloud OCC REST APIs that Spartacus consumes. For more information, see the [Commerce Cloud API Documentation and YAML Files](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c5613bd3cc9942efb74d017b40eb0892/latest/en-US/18caa4b5c32c4bcf8b38c6260c0f30e8.html) on the SAP Help Portal.
