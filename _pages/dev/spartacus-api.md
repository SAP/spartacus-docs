title: Spartacus API
---

The Spartacus API documentation is hosted here: [https://sap.github.io/spartacus/](https://sap.github.io/spartacus/)

The API documentation is versioned and is included in the **Assets** folder of each and every Spartacus library. You can download the API documentation for a particular version by accessing the **Assets** folder of any Spartacus library from that particular release, and then clicking on `docs.tar.gz` or `docs.zip`. To find the **Assets** folder for a particular library, access the [Released Libraries for Spartacus](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/releases), click on the link for the library you are interested in, and scroll to the bottom of the page.

For example, to download the API documentation for the 1.5.5 release, you could access the **Assets** folder of the `@spartacus/storefront@1.5.5` library [here](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/releases/tag/storefront-1.5.5).

**Note:** The 1.x and 2.x releases of the Spartacus libraries work only with SAP Commerce versions 1905 and 2005. Certain features, such as cancellations and returns, are only available with SAP Commerce 2005, because the necessary OCC API support is only available in SAP Commerce 2005.

**Note:** The Spartacus API is separate from the Commerce OCC REST APIs that Spartacus consumes. For more information, see the [Commerce API Documentation and YAML Files](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c5613bd3cc9942efb74d017b40eb0892/latest/en-US/18caa4b5c32c4bcf8b38c6260c0f30e8.html) on the SAP Help Portal.
