title: Main Actions with Form Pages
---

This page details some of the design considerations for Main Actions on pages which have form fields.

## Submit, Continue and Similar Actions Should **ALWAYS** be Enabled

Action buttons on form field pages should always be enabled. Clicking on the action should generate relevant inline and page notifications.

## Submit, Continue and Similar Actions Should NEVER be Disabled

At no point should any form field page have a main action that is greyed out.

## Blank Form Advancement

The user should be free to click on the action button when all fields are empty to generate relevant inline and page notifications.
