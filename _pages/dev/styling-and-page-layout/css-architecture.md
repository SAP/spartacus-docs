This page provides a high level overview of the CSS architecture in Spartacus.

## Style Library

Spartacus is provided as a set of standard components that are distributed in npm libraries. These libraries help to ensure that Spartacus remains both extensible and upgradable at the same time.

To deliver as much flexibility as possible for styling, all of the CSS rules are provided in a separate `@spartacus/styles` library. This makes the styles completely optional, configurable, and extensible. You can extend or replace the standard styles, and also implement your own style rules.

Additionally, an existing UI framework, such as Bootstrap, can be used in Spartacus without making it a hard-coded dependency.

### Style Versioning

Spartacus libraries support semantic versioning, which means that breaking changes are not allowed during the life cycle of a major version. This is also true for the style library. A new style rule, or an adjusted rule, that would lead to a difference in the UI experience, is considered a breaking change. Spartacus libraries are released with the assumption that customers are relying on the semantic versioning scheme, so breaking changes, such as implicit changes to the style library, will not be made during the life cycle of a major release.

At the same time, it is likely that Spartacus will evolve from one minor version to the next. To allow for gradual changes in the style layer, new or adjusted style rules are added for a specific version, but these changes are not added in the style build process unless you explicitly opt in to receive these changes. You need to set a single variable to leverage the latest breaking styles changes. Note that non-breaking changes are added regardless.

The following example illustrates an additional style for version 2.2:

```scss
cx-mini-cart {
  @include forVersion(2.1) {
    background: blue;
  }
  @include forVersion(2.2) {
    background: deepskyblue;
  }
}
```

If you use any `2.x` Spartacus release, you would not get the styles added through the mixin `forVersion`. Only if you explicitly request a `styleVersion` of 1 or higher will you have those rules applied. The versioning includes all the previous changes, which means that you would receive all of the breaking changes up until the given version. The following example illustrates opting in to receive all style rules up until minor version 2:

```scss
// Add this in styles.scss, before importing
// the library styles.
$styleVersion: 2;
```

Alternatively, you can use a special flag to always receive the latest styles. This can be useful for development, demos, or proofs of concept. The following is an example:

```scss
// Add this in styles.scss, before importing
// the library styles.
$useLatestStyles: true;
```

**Note:** The optional style changes that are introduced in minor versions are typically included by default in the following major release.

**Note:** In Spartacus 1.x, style versioning was managed with the optional `Calydon` theme, which was used to add new style rules into the style layer. The new versioning technique for Spartacus 2.x makes this theme-based versioning technique obsolete. As a result, the `Calydon` theme is no longer used or supported in Spartacus 2.x.

## CSS Technology

Spartacus is developed with a combination of the following CSS techniques:

- [SASS](https://github.com/sass/node-sass), which is used as the pre-processing language, just like in most of today's UI frameworks.
- [CSS custom properties](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp), which are used for global theming.
- [CSS post-processing](https://postcss.org/), which is intended to be used to polyfill any of the required syntax for older browsers.

### View Encapsulation

View encapsulation ensures the isolation of styles in a single DOM. View encapsulation can be used to ensure that the component style rules from one component do not interfere with other components. View encapsulation is standardized in a web component architecture, and is provided by the shadow DOM. For applications that do not leverage the shadow DOM, there are a few alternatives that are available, such as the following:

- **Emulated encapsulation:** Angular provides emulated view encapsulation by adding a (random) component ID to the generated CSS, so that the CSS rules are tightly coupled with the component and will not interfere with other components.
- **BEM:** BEM is an older technique that uses a very specific class name convention to make the component styles specific to the given element(s).
- **iFrames:** This technique is only mentioned for completeness, but is not a viable option due to a number of disadvantages, including poor user experience.

None of the above techniques work for Spartacus. Angular's emulated encapsulation cannot be used because the component styles are provided by the style library. BEM is considered old-fashioned and complex. Moreover, a well defined, fine-grained component architecture does not need BEM to encapsulate the styles.

Instead, the fine-grained component selectors are used to encapsulate the styling. For more information, see [Component Styles](#component-styles), below.

## Global Theming

Global theming is organized with variables so that the theming is not hard coded. For variables, there are two common approaches that you can work with:

- SASS variables
- CSS custom properties (in other words, CSS variables).

Spartacus uses CSS variables for theming. CSS variables have the advantage of being runtime configurable. Moreover, they can pierce through the shadow DOM (that is, web components). Additionally, CSS variables are inherited and offer more flexibility than SASS variables.

Theming variables contribute to the so-called "contract" that Spartacus provides to customers. This contract is intended to be stable, and should rarely change. Only with major releases, Spartacus could introduce a new set of variables, but this is not considered best practice.

To provide a stable set of variables, the CSS variables in Spartacus are mainly used for color schemes and font definitions. These can be considered as a set of the global theming definition.

The following is an example of a CSS variable:

```css
:root {
  --cx-color-primary: red;
}

cx-link {
  color: var(--cx-color-primary);
}
```

CSS variables can be customized on the root of the document, or for specific selectors.

## Component Styles

Spartacus consists of a large number of components that you can use to build your storefront experience. While commerce may be a commodity, styling is by nature a subjective topic. Not only the choices of colors and fonts, but also the real estate of components, as well as the backgrounds, the lines, and so on.

No matter what Spartacus delivers, it will not represent your brand or corporate identity. For this reason, Spartacus is meant to be highly flexible, so that you can extend component styles, or skip them entirely.

Since Spartacus components are built and distributed in libraries, component styles cannot be used. These styles would be pre-processed and baked into the component library. This means that the CSS rules would not be optional, nor would they be easily customizable.

Instead, component styles are delivered optionally in the styles library. You can use those styles, extend them, or completely skip them and build your CSS rules from scratch. The contract between the style library and the component library is done through the (unique) component selector.

### Placeholder Selectors

To make the CSS rules provided in the style library completely optional, the styles are wrapped in placeholder selectors. Placeholder selectors are a SASS technique that starts with a percentage, such as `%cx-mini-cart`. Placeholder selectors are not added to the final CSS. Instead, they need to be explicitly extended to end up in the final CSS.

The following is an example of a component style that uses a placeholder selector:

```scss
%cx-link {
  a {
    display: inline;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    color: currentColor;
    display: block;
  }
}
```

While the placeholder selector can be safely imported, it will only affect the final CSS if it has been used explicitly. The styling can therefore be extended as follows:

```scss
cx-link {
  @extend %cx-link !optional;
  a {
    color: red;
  }
}
```

The `optional` flag ensures that the code will not break during the build, whenever a specific import is not part of the imported styles.

Spartacus generates the component by iterating over the configured component selectors.

### Skipping Specific Component Styles

Component styles are optional because they are pulled in from the style library. Accordingly, you might want to disable some standard component styles entirely. To disable standard component styles, you can add the component selectors to the `$skipComponentStyles` list. The following is an example that demonstrates skipping two standard components from the style library:

```scss
$skipComponentStyles: (cx-product-carousel, cx-searchbox);
```

Skipping specific component styles might be beneficial if you need to create styles from scratch and do not want to override specific style rules coming from the Spartacus style library.

## Page Layout Styles

Global theming and component styles are most important to render components on the page. However, the overall layout that orchestrates components on a page is another important style layer.
