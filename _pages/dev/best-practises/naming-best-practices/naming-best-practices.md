title: Naming Best Practices
---

We highly recommend naming all custom elements with a project prefix. This will avoid problems with importing elements. It is easy to mistake a custom module with a Spartacus module, for example:

Instead of own module `CartTotalModule` use `<your_prefix>CartTotalModule` where `your_prefix` is globally used prefix in the project.
