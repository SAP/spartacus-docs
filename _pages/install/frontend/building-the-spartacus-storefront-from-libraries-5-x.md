## Using Spartacus with SAP Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud

With the release of Spartacus 5.0, the hosting service of SAP Commerce Cloud cannot be used for building your Spartacus application. As a workaround, you can build your Spartacus app locally, and upload the compiled application, as follows:

1. Follow all of the steps on this page to set up your Spartacus application, up to and including [Installing Dependencies](#installing-dependencies).
2. Run `yarn build`.

   A new `dist` folder is created in the root directory of your Spartacus project.

3. Commit the `dist` folder to your code repository for SAP Commerce Cloud.

   For more information, see [Adding Applications for JavaScript Storefronts](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/b2f400d4c0414461a4bb7e115dccd779/63577f67a67347bf9f4765a5385ead33.html).

## Prerequisites

If you are using a version of SAP Commerce Cloud that is older than 2211, you will need the `webApplicationInjector.js` file that ships with your version of SAP Commerce Cloud. For more information, see [Updating the Web Application Injector]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/install/frontend/building-the-spartacus-storefront-from-libraries-5-x.md %}#updating-the-web-application-injector).

## Front End Development Requirements

{% include docs/frontend_requirements.html %}

## Back End Server Requirements

Spartacus uses SAP Commerce Cloud for its back end and makes use of the sample data. Spartacus can only be used with SAP Commerce Cloud 2105 or newer; the latest release is recommended. The difference between releases is in the APIs and features available. Newer releases of SAP Commerce Cloud contain new OCC APIs that enable the use of new features. For more information on which back end releases contain which APIs, see [{% assign linkedpage = site.pages | where: "name", "feature-release-versions.md" %}{{ linkedpage[0].title }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/home/feature-release-versions.md %}).

No matter the version, the latest patch is required, as important fixes are often added that affect Spartacus.

## Creating a New Angular App

The following procedure describes how to create a new Angular application with the name `mystore`.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt window at the location of your choice.

2. Using the Angular CLI, generate a new Angular application with the following command:

   ```bash
   ng new mystore --style=scss --routing=false
   ```

   The `mystore` folder and the new app are created.

3. Access the newly created `mystore` folder with the following command:

   ```shell
   cd mystore
   ```

## Downloading Spartacus Libraries from the Repository Based Shipment Channel

To install Spartacus 5.0, you need to download the Spartacus 5.0 libraries from the Repository Based Shipment Channel (RBSC), as described in the following procedure.

1. Create an S-user for RBSC that has the appropriate licenses to download the Spartacus libraries.
1. Log into your S-user account at the following web address: `https://ui.repositories.cloud.sap/www/webapp/users/`
1. If you have not already done so, click on **Add User** and create a technical user.
1. In the root of your Angular application, create an `.npmrc` file with the following content:

   ```text
   @spartacus:registry=https://<repositorynumber>.npmsrv.base.repositories.cloud.sap/
   //<repositorynumber>.npmsrv.base.repositories.cloud.sap/:_auth=<npmcredentialsfromrbsc>
   always-auth=true
   ```

   **Note:** The two slashes (`//`) at the start of the second line are required.

1. Replace the two instances of `<repositorynumber>` with the repository number for the release, which is provided by SAP.
1. In the **User Management** tab of the [RBSC website](https://ui.repositories.cloud.sap/www/webapp/users/), select the technical user and copy the generated `NPM Base64 Credentials`.
1. In the `.npmrc` file, replace `<npmcredentialsfromrbsc>` with the `NPM Base64 Credentials` you copied from the RBSC website.

You can now proceed to [Spartacus Project Setup](#spartacus-project-setup).

## Spartacus Project Setup

The easiest way to start a new project is to use Spartacus schematics to quickly set up your application.

For a full list of available parameters, see [{% assign linkedpage = site.pages | where: "name", "schematics.md" %}{{ linkedpage[0].title }}]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/install/schematics.md %}).

## Setting Up Your Project Using Schematics

Run the following command to install the latest official release of Spartacus using schematics:

```bash
ng add @spartacus/schematics@5.0.0
```

When you run this command, you are asked to choose which features you would like to set up. Some of the features are already selected by default, but this is only a suggested setup. You can select and unselect the features that are relevant for your installation, although it is highly recommended to install the `User - Account` feature.

## Notes

- **Spartacus does not support B2C and B2B storefronts running together in a single storefront application**. If you install  any of the B2B features, the B2C storefront will load but it will not work properly.
- If you select a feature that is for B2B storefronts, the schematics automatically add any required B2B configurations if they are missing. **If you install any of the following features, your Spartacus storefront will automatically become a B2B storefront**:
  - `Organization - Adminstration`
  - `Organization - Order Approval`
  - `Product - Bulk Pricing`
  - `Product Configurator - CPQ Configurator`
- The schematics add the core Spartacus files and configuration that are needed to work with the SAP Commerce Cloud sample stores.
- To install the latest "next" release, you can add `@next` at the end of the command.
- To install the latest release candidate, you can add `@rc` at the end of the command.
- To verify what versions of Spartacus libraries were installed, open `package.json` and look for `@spartacus`.
- To bypass the schematics prompts and install Spartacus with a predefined set of features, you can use the `--no-interactive` flag. For more information, see [Adding Spartacus Core Libraries and Features to Your Angular Project]({{ site.baseurl }}/schematics/#adding-spartacus-core-libraries-and-features-to-your-angular-project).
- With each release of Spartacus, existing features are moved out of the core libraries and into their own dedicated feature libraries. With time, the core libraries will shrink as features are extracted to their own, separate packages.

## Installing Dependencies

Install dependencies needed by your Spartacus app with the following command:

```shell
yarn install
```

## Checking spartacus-configuration.module.ts for Base URL and Other Settings

Open the `src\app\spartacus\spartacus-configuration.module.ts` file, and check for any changes you want to make for your setup.

For example, check:

- `baseUrl`: Points to your SAP Commerce Cloud server.
- `prefix`: Defines the prefix for OCC calls.
  - The default for Spartacus libraries 3.0 and later is `/occ/v2/`; this entry is not added by schematics.
  - If using 2005 or later, the default backend prefix is `/occ/v2/`.
  - If using 1905, or 2005 with the OCC AddOn, add the line `prefix: '/rest/v2/'`.
- `features.level`: Defines the compatibility level
- `context`: Defines the site context such as base site, language, and currency.
  - To see the base site in the URL and add Apparel store support, change `context` to the following:

     ```ts
     context: {
     urlParameters: ['baseSite', 'language', 'currency'],
     baseSite: ['electronics-spa','apparel-uk-spa'],
     currency: ['USD', 'GBP',]
     },
     ```

  - If using Powertools, add `powertools-spa` to the list in `baseSite`.
  
## Updating the Web Application Injector

For Spartacus to work with SmartEdit, your Spartacus application needs to use the `webApplicationInjector.js` file that is shipped with the version of SAP Commerce Cloud that you are using. In Spartacus 5.0, the `webApplicationInjector.js` file has been updated to work with SAP Commerce Cloud 2211. If you are using SAP Commerce Cloud 2211, then no action is required. However, if you are using an older version of SAP Commerce Cloud, then you need to replace the `webApplicationInjector.js` file in your Spartacus application with the `webApplicationInjector.js` file that is included with your version of SAP Commerce Cloud. For more information, see [Web Application Injector](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/e1391e5265574bfbb56ca4c0573ba1dc/e9340d1d3d3249849ff154731277069a.html).

## Starting Your Spartacus App

Start your app with the following command:

```shell
yarn start
```

Your app will be compiled and then started.

To display your storefront, assuming everything is installed locally, browse to `http://localhost:4200`. If you installed Electronics sample data and the Spartacus Sample Data extension, the Spartacus storefront for Electronics should appear.

**Note:** If your storefront doesn't appear, likely you have to accept a privacy certificate. To do so, browse to `https://localhost:9002/occ/v2/electronics/cms/pages` (or `../rest/..` if using 1905), and then accept the privacy certificate. This step is necessary because your browser will block calls the app will make to `localhost:9002` due to security settings. To see the browser message, right-click in your browser, select **Inspect**, then click **Console**.

- You can display the Apparel storefront through this URL: `http://localhost:4200/apparel-uk-spa/en/GBP`
- You can display the Powertools storefront through this URL: `http://localhost:4200/powertools-spa/en/USD`

Congratulations! You've built your first Spartacus storefront.
