title: Personalization Setup Instructions for Spartacus (DRAFT)
---

For the following steps, the Electronics sample site is used along with the Spartacus Sample Data Addon.

## Back End Extension Requirements

Make sure all the required personalization extensions and AddOns are installed in your SAP Commerce Cloud instance. For more information, see the [Personalization installation instructions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/86dd1373053a4c2da8f9885cc9fbe55d/latest/en-US/6a0dae49ef2c4fe3b475084079cb7360.html) for your release.

## Back End CORS Settings

As described in [Configure Personalization for Commerce Web Services](https://help.sap.com/viewer/86dd1373053a4c2da8f9885cc9fbe55d/latest/en-US/e970070f997041c7b3f3e77fcb762744.html), add `occ-personalization-id` and `occ-personalization-time` to the following settings:

- `corsfilter.ycommercewebservices.allowedHeaders`
- `corsfilter.ycommercewebservices.exposedHeaders`

If a setting doesn't exist, create it.

If the setting already exists, add the new values to the end, including a space before. For example, `allowedHeaders` might look like this:

```
origin content-type accept authorization occ-personalization-id occ-personalization-time
```

**Note:** You can edit these settings using HAC, but you can also add these parameters to `local.properties` in the `hybris/config` folder or in the `project.properties` file of ycommercewebservices.

## Personalization Configuration in Backoffice

1. In Backoffice, go to `Personalization > Configuration > Personalization Configuration`.

2. Select **Electronics Site**.

3. In the Properties tab, General section, add **Spartacus Electronics Site** to **Set of base sites**.

4. In the Commerce Web Services tab, set **Personalization for Commerce Web Services** to **True**.

  To test that the configuration is working:

  - Send an OCC REST API call to your site. You should see `Occ-Personalization-Id` in the response header. 
  - Send the call again but with `Occ-Personalization-Id: yourid` in the header,  and you should also see `Occ-Personalization-Time`.

## Enabling Personalization in Spartacus

In `app.module.ts`, add the following to the settings in the `StorefrontModule.withConfig` section:

```
personalization: {
  enabled: true,
},
```

## Testing Personalization
