  <p>If you are working with an older version of the Spartacus libraries, you can find the full suite of corresponding documentation in our <a href="https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/docs-archive/">Documentation Archive.</a></p>
  
  <p>Spartacus is a lean, Angular-based JavaScript storefront for SAP Commerce Cloud. Spartacus talks to SAP Commerce Cloud exclusively through the Commerce REST API.</p>

  <p>Spartacus is also an open source project. You can view the Spartacus source code in this <a href="https://github.com/SAP/spartacus">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="extensible">Extensible</h2>

  <p>Spartacus is designed to be upgradable while maintaining full extendability. You'll be able to adopt new versions of Spartacus by updating the Spartacus libraries that we will regularly enhance.</p>

  <p>Version 1.0.0 was released July 4, 2019, a month after SAP Commerce Cloud 1905. </p>

  <h2 id="progressive">Progressive</h2>

  <p>Spartacus is on a journey to be fully compliant with the Progressive Web Application (PWA) checklist. We aim to add support for all major features of a PWA-enabled storefront, to offer the best possible customer experience regardless of device or location.</p>

  <h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>

  <p>Spartacus is open source. It will be continually developed by the SAP Commerce Cloud team, but we are very keen to welcome contributors and to foster an inclusive, active development community for Spartacus.</p>

  <p>See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contributing/contributing-to-the-spartacus-storefront.md %}">Contributing to the Spartacus Storefront</a> for more information.</p>

  <h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

  <p>The Spartacus storefront is part of our exciting new journey towards a customizable-yet-upgradable technology for SAP Commerce Cloud installations.</p>

  <p>See <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/e-commerce-platforms.html">SAP Customer Experience</a> for more information about SAP Commerce Cloud.</p>

  <h2 id="storefront-features">Storefront features</h2>

  <p>Spartacus provides core storefront features such as:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>home page</li>

    <li>search</li>

    <li>categories</li>

    <li>product details</li>

    <li>cart page</li>

    <li>adding to cart</li>

    <li>checkout</li>

    <li>order history</li>

  </ul>

  <h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

  {% include docs/frontend_requirements.html %}

  <p>For the back end, SAP Commerce Cloud version 1905 or higher is required.</p>

  <h1 id="download-and-installation">Download and Installation</h1>

  <p>To get up and running with Spartacus, the recommended approach is to build your storefront application from ready-made libraries. You can also clone and build from source, but upgrading is not as simple.</p>

  <p>Spartacus currently can only be used with a SAP Commerce Cloud instance through Commerce Cloud APIs.</p>

  <p>For complete setup instructions, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/install/building-the-spartacus-storefront-from-libraries.md %}">Building the Spartacus Storefront from Libraries</a> guide.</p>

  <h2 id="customizing-and-extending-spartacus">Customizing and Extending Spartacus</h2>

  <p>To maintain our promise of upgradability, the design pattern for Spartacus is for non-core features to be built as feature libraries that add to or change the provided functionality.</p>

  <p>When using Spartacus, you build an app that pulls in the Spartacus libraries, which contain the core resources needed to work with SAP Commerce Cloud. You then build new features that contain any custom functionality and pages.</p>

  <p>Content for Spartacus pages is fetched from the SAP Commerce Cloud CMS (Content Management System), such as logos, links, banners and static pages. We recommend that new content-driven features follow the same pattern to enable Content Managers to modify page content through the CMS tools.</p>

  <p>The documentation for customizing and extending Spartacus is still under development and is being released as it becomes available.</p>

  <h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>

  <p>With the release of 1.0.0, it is recommended to use SAP Commerce Cloud 1905. Spartacus works with Release 1808 and 1811 of SAP Commerce Cloud, with some limitations.

  <p>Spartacus is also being updated so that it works well with upcoming releases of SAP Commerce Cloud. This means that certain features of Spartacus may only work with unreleased future editions of SAP Commerce Cloud. This will be noted as we release new versions of Spartacus.</p>
