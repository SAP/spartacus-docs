<h2 id="release-20">Release 2.0</h2>
<p><em>Release 2.0 libraries published March 17, 2021</em></p>

<p>List of features delivered with 2.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Additional Policy Changes</strong></dt>
      <dd>The Policy Change Process framework enables insurance carriers to provide their customers with the possibility to change their policy online. In addition to sample processes for changing mileage and adding coverage, customers can now add the additional driver and remove coverage. All sample processes are provided based on the Auto Insurance product.  The policy change can be initiated for effective policies, and the customer can choose one of the available policy changes. Once the process is started, customers can specify the desired change and then be presented with a simulated premium. The policy change can then be submitted or canceled if the simulated premium does not match the customer’s expectation. The Policy Change Process is based on the User Request Framework, allowing business users to make changes in the process directly from Backoffice.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Claims Integration Enhancements</strong></dt>
      <dd>The Financial Services Accelerator is seamlessly integrated with SAP Claims Management. When a first notice of loss is submitted via the Financial Services Accelerator, it reaches SAP Claims Management, and if all data is valid, a claim is created. Besides form data, the customer can upload documents, and the document data will be forwarded to the SAP Claims Management. General information about the claim, e.g., claim number, status, and claim handler information, is then sent back to Financial Services Accelerator as a response to the first notice of loss call.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Document Upload</strong></dt>
      <dd>Document upload offers the possibility to upload additional information in a certain process, which also helps banks and insurers to collect all needed information and documents during a process (e.g., application or quotations processes, claims process). The customer can upload one or more documents in the same process. During the document upload, customers can download or remove already uploaded documents. Two document storage strategies are provided:</dd>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>SAP Commerce Cloud, financial services accelerator</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>External DMS by using provided integration mechanisms (prepackaged integration with SAP Document Management service available).</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Invoice Payment</strong></dt>
      <dd>During the quotation process, the customer can choose to pay either with a credit card or through an invoice in the Payment Details step. If an invoice method is selected, the customer proceeds to the Final Review step without adding any additional information. In the case of a credit card payment method, the customer first needs to register a new credit card.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Order Splitting</strong></dt>
      <dd>Order splitting allows orders to be broken down into several consignments interfaces, which permits separate billing and shipment of third-party products. The Order Splitting process in the Financial Services Accelerator is visible on the Auto Product sample when a customer decides to include winter tires into their auto policy. Once the order is submitted, for each set of order entries, a consignment is created. In this case, the order is split into two consignments - one for the policy itself, and the second for the third-party product. The policy is then processed via a policy management system. As the policy is issued, the customer can see its details in My Account &gt; Policies. The third-party product is charged as a one-time payment and shipped to the customer. Customers are informed via email about the shipment and can track their order in the newly added Order History page in the ‘My Account’ area. This is also where customers can see all the details of the order they have created.</dd>

<h2 id="about-fsa-spartacus-releases">About FSA Spartacus Releases</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Libraries that are “released” are new, official, tested Spartacus libraries available to the public (hosted on npmjs.com).</li>
  <li>A minor change means we added new features, but they are configured to be off by default, not to cause compatibility issues. A new minor can also include changes or bug fixes that may affect compatibility, but feature flags also control these. So all significant changes are “opt-in”. See feature flag documentation for more information.</li>
  <li>We will normally publish pre-release libraries labelled ‘next’ a few weeks before a new minor release. The goal is to provide early access to new features and get feedback from the community.</li>
  <li>If you choose not to use a new feature, you should have no problems upgrading to a new Major.# with features flag set to a previous Major.#. If you do see a problem, please report a bug, and we’ll assess and fix it. We encourage you to upgrade to the latest libraries frequently during development in order to take advantage of bug fixes and new features.</li>
  <li>To use all functionalities in FSA Spartacus 2.*, release 2011 of SAP Commerce Cloud and 2102 of Financial Services Accelerator is required.</li>
  <li>The latest patch release is strongly recommended, as it usually contains bug fixes that affect Spartacus.</li>
</ul>
