<h2 id="release-13">Release 1.3</h2>

<p><em>Release 1.3.0 libraries published November 11, 2020</em></p>

<p>What’s new?</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/cost-estimation/">Cost Estimation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>While it can be hard to pinpoint precisely how much your electric and water bill will cost each month, the Cost Estimation feature helps provide an indication as to the average monthly bill for a given product offering based on the anticipated consumption provided by a customer.  Leveraging the anticipated usage provided by a customer, the estimated monthly and annual cost for applicable product offerings can be presented to the customer.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/journey-management-serviceability/">Journey Management - Serviceability (Premise Details)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Customers interested in acquiring product offerings, such as commodity items (for example,  electricity or gas) need to have an availability check of the premise details. As an  example, the premise address and meter id is needed to conduct a serviceability check for a commodity product offering.  For more information, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/2011/en-US/39a59f20c92f4a0090c7ef2d007d623c.html">Serviceability example</a> in the TUA Help portal.</p>

</ul>

<p>Journey Management facilitates real-time personalized customer journeys enabling online customers to successfully place an order. With the MSISDN checklist action in place, customers who wish to purchase a simple product offering that requires an MSISDN selection, will be required to select their new telephone number as part of the ordering process. For more information, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/2007/en-US/39a59f20c92f4a0090c7ef2d007d623c.html">Journey Management</a> in the TUA Help portal.</p>

<h2 id="release-11">Release 1.1</h2>

<p><em>Release 1.1.0 libraries published October 7, 2020</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/journey-management-appointment/">Journey Management - Appointment</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Journey Management facilitates real-time personalized customer journeys enabling online customers to successfully place an order. With the appointment checklist action in place, customers that wish to purchase a simple product offering that requires an appointment to be scheduled, will be required to make the appointment selection as part of the ordering process. For more information, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/2007/en-US/39a59f20c92f4a0090c7ef2d007d623c.html">Journey Management</a> in the TUA Help portal.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/customer-product-inventory/">Customer Product Inventory (CPI)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Increase NPS with the Customer Product Inventory. This features helps companies understand their customers by having a complete view of the “recurring” relationships or assets, their customers have with them. The Customer Product Inventory is used to dynamically determine user journeys: what the customer is interested in, what they are willing to pay, and what products, services, and prices they are entitled to. For more information, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/2007/en-US/612f26c3d5f14248965ad908cf5952f6.html">Customer Product Inventory (CPI)</a> in the TUA Help portal.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/consumption/">Consumption</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Maximize customer retention by understanding the consumption of services by customers.  Not all customers are created equal. Some subscribers are more valuable than others. With consumption data available, companies are able to analyze the data and provide customers with some highly engaging content, upgrades, or promotional offers to keep subscribers engaged. On the flip side, with consumption data visible, customers are able to see for themselves how much of the services they are actually consuming, which helps them maximize their investment and make more informative decision. For more information, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/2007/en-US/ba5f222fb5814829bd74eaf6e6505a9f.html">Create Average Service Usage for Subscribed Product</a> in the TUA Help portal.</p>

<h2 id="release-10">Release 1.0</h2>

<p><em>Release 1.0.0 libraries published September 9, 2020</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/simple-product-offering/">Simple Product Offering</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The commercial product catalog for service industries is different and the distinction between product offerings and products is important to understand. Simple product offerings are different than retail products and represents what is externally presented to the market. For more information, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/c762d9007c5c4f38bafbe4788446983e/2007/en-US/6d3b4c0b88b04b709774c8ad10baa7a8.html?q=simple%20product%20offering">Simple Product Offerings</a> in the TUA Help portal.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/product-offering-search/">Product Offering Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To support the commercial product catalog of product offerings, changes were required in the way “searches” are technically conducted to search for and find simple product offerings. Changes were made in the areas of free text search, facets, and top level category menu navigation. For more information, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/32f0086927f44c9ab1199f1dab8833cd/2007/en-US/315410098c024e50adf4c43373761936.html">Product Offering Search</a> in the TUA Help portal.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/cart/">Cart</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To support product offerings and the complex pricing structure they have for one time charges, recurring charges and usage charges, changes to the cart were necessary.

<h2 id="about-spartacus-for-tua-releases">About Spartacus for TUA Releases</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Libraries that are “released” are new, official, tested TUA Spartacus libraries available to the public (hosted on npmjs.com)</li>
  <li>We usually publish new libraries every 2 weeks</li>
  <li>Similar to Spartacus: A change in minor means we added new features, but they are configured to be off by default, so as not to cause compatibility issues. A new minor also means inclusion of changes or bug fixes that may affect compatibility, but these are also controlled by feature flags. So all significant changes are “opt-in”. See feature flag documentation for more information.</li>
  <li>We will normally publish pre-release libraries labelled ‘next’ a few weeks before a new minor release. The goal is to provide early access to new features and get feedback from the community.</li>
  <li>If you choose not to use a new feature, you should have no problems upgrading to a new Major.# with features flag set to a previous Major.#. If you do see a problem, please report a bug and we’ll assess and fix it. We encourage you to upgrade to latest libraries frequently during development in order to take advantage of bug fixes and new features.</li>
  <li>Please visit our Spartacus for TUA Compatibility Matrix to understand requirements. For more information, see <a href="/spartacus-docs/2.x/tua-feature-release-versions/">Feature Release Versions</a>.</li>
  <li>To use all functionality in Spartacus 2.*, release 2005 of SAP Commerce Cloud and 2007 of Telco &amp; Utilities Accelerator is required.</li>
  <li>The latest patch release is required or at least strongly recommended, as it usually contains bug fixes that affect Spartacus</li>
</ul>
