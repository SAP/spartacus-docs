<p>Your Angular development environment should include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular CLI:</a> Version <strong>12.0.5</strong> or later, &lt; 13.</li>
    <li><a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/">Yarn:</a> Version <strong>1.15</strong> or later.</li>
    <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js:</a> The most recent <strong>14.x</strong> version is required. Version 12.x reached end-of-life on April 30, 2022, and is no longer supported by Spartacus. It is strongly recommended that you migrate any existing Spartacus storefronts to Node.js 14 as soon as possible. If there are any issues with Spartacus and Node.js 14, please upgrade to the latest releases. If you continue to experience issues with Node.js 14, create a support ticket with SAP. Spartacus also supports version 16.x of Node.js.
