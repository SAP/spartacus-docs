# Developers: Contributing to Documentation

All documentation resides in this repository. If you plan to contribute, please clone this repository before continuing with the steps below.

## Making Updates to the Doc Repo

Whether you are creating a new doc, or updating an existing doc, the steps are the same.

1. Create a new issue in the documentation repo: https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront-docs/issues

   **Tip:** If you have a related issue in the Spartacus repository, it is a good idea to add a comment in that issue with the link to this new issue (and vice versa). The normal GitHub shortcuts (# or GH-xx) won't work, so use the full URL. GitHub can still track if the issue is open, merged, closed, etc.

2. Create a new branch in the documentation repo, using the issue number of the issue you created in the previous step. The branch naming convention is `doc/GH-issue-number`. If you new issue number is #42, for example, then you name your new branch `doc/GH-42`.
